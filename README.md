# DeepLearning Project - Visual Question Generation & Answering on Radiology Images

Implemented two distinct models: the visual question generation (VQG) and the visual question answering (VQA), to generate natural language questions and answers from 3200 medical images dataset(radiographs). Extracted image features from different convolution layers using the pre-trained ResNet-152 for the VQA model. Achieved a BLEU score of 0.6124 for the VQA model after doing the transfer learning on the pre-trained model.
